â€‹- backend for the front end is run using Python code that is contained within the Api_backend_server folder.

- launch a new terminal and find API_Backend_Server by typing "cd API_Backend_Server" 

- to run the actual python file which is the backend you need to type "python backend.py" to make the backend, which contains all the database data work.

- to access one of the tables in backend then at the end of the link add the specified table. For example, this is the link you'll get. http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

- This is what you'll add to the end of the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/artists

- To operate front end after the backend is up:

Launch new terminal, type We must get the front end operational after the backend is operational. To accomplish this, type "cd API_FrontEnd_viewer".
This will take you to the API_FrontEnd_viewer folder
- Use npm run dev to launch front end

Inside the SetUp - python book and setup code is a jupyter note book that fecthes and updates data as well as creates the database.
